# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the first JavaScript project I am officially doing completely on my own! While I still have plenty to learn and the project has been challenging, I am practicing my ability to solve these problems myself and, rather than watch a tutorial, I have been looking up specific questions I have to address challenges that I encounter and struggle to find solutions for myself. By doing this I am learning a lot more by overcoming the challenges more independently.

While the project is still a work in process, I am continuing to work on it amid other topics I am learning, and plan to have it completed soon!
